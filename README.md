# Elon-Musk-CARBON-CAPTURE-WITH-SODIUM-SILICATE-MESOPOROUS-SILICA-AEROGELS
This repository aims to show the study on carbon capture technology, and on the changes that I find interesting to make in them.

### Overview
![Carbon capture with sodium silicate mesoporous silica aerogels](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58941489/105650975-4b835100-5e94-11eb-9ead-7ec82ce3eb4e.png)

### Extra points
- These filters can be used in petrochemical industries because in addition to reducing their CO2 emission, besides generating raw material for other products;
- This aerogel have a CO2 absorption flux of 1.5 mmol/m2 s ยน ;
- Can be used at least 4 days;
- Is more efficient than other membrane filters like PP;

### Notes

I will try to put new updates both of this and other technologies, whoever wants to help contact me

### Disclaimer

I'm not the creator of this technology, I'm just showing my vision and other ways of using them
